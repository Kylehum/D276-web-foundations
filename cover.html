                I currently work in tech at Intel as a 3D bonding tech in Technology Research. I have been working in tech for over 8 years and am very interested in diving 
                deeper into the tech world. I previously worked as a front end etch technician and also worked for Applied Materials as an install engineer where I installed plasma
                etch tools for customers. With my experience at both of these companies I think I will be a great fit for your team in the tech world. Outside of tech I have experience 
                law enforcement, wildland firefighting, and the military where I built communication, leadership, discipline, and problem solving skills that will aslo contribute greatly
                to your team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would love the opportunity to discuss my experience, skills and how I can benefit your team in further detail. You can contact me by both phone or email.
